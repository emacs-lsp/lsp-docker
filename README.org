** Usage
   There are two ways of working with containerized language servers:
   - 2 containers provided by =lsp-docker=:
      - [[#emacslsplsp-docker-langservers][emacslsp/lsp-docker-langservers]]
      - [[#emacslsplsp-docker-full][emacslsp/lsp-docker-full]]
   - [[#custom-language-server-containers][Custom language server containers]]

** emacslsp/lsp-docker-langservers
   This container is used by =lsp-docker= to run =Language Servers= for =lsp-mode= over local sources.
   =You must pull the container before lsp-docker can use it=
*** Configuration
    - Clone the repo
      #+begin_src bash
      git clone https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-docker
      #+end_src
    - Pull the container
      #+begin_src bash
      docker pull emacslsp/lsp-docker-langservers
      #+end_src
    - Add repo to load path and register the docker clients in your =~/.emacs= file
      #+begin_src elisp
      ;; Uncomment the next line if you are using this from source
      ;; (add-to-list 'load-path "<path-to-lsp-docker-dir>")
      (require 'lsp-docker)

      (defvar lsp-docker-client-packages
          '(lsp-css lsp-clients lsp-bash lsp-go lsp-pyls lsp-html lsp-typescript
            lsp-terraform lsp-clangd))

      (setq lsp-docker-client-configs
          '((:server-id bash-ls :docker-server-id bashls-docker :server-command "bash-language-server start")
            (:server-id clangd :docker-server-id clangd-docker :server-command "clangd")
            (:server-id css-ls :docker-server-id cssls-docker :server-command "css-languageserver --stdio")
            (:server-id dockerfile-ls :docker-server-id dockerfilels-docker :server-command "docker-langserver --stdio")
            (:server-id gopls :docker-server-id gopls-docker :server-command "gopls")
            (:server-id html-ls :docker-server-id htmls-docker :server-command "html-languageserver --stdio")
            (:server-id pyls :docker-server-id pyls-docker :server-command "pyls")
            (:server-id ts-ls :docker-server-id tsls-docker :server-command "typescript-language-server --stdio")))

      (require 'lsp-docker)
      (lsp-docker-init-clients
        :path-mappings '(("path-to-projects-you-want-to-use" . "/projects"))
        :client-packages lsp-docker-client-packages
        :client-configs lsp-docker-client-configs)
      #+end_src
*** How it works
    =lsp-mode= starts the image passed as =:docker-image-id= and mounts =:path-mappings= in the container. Then when the process is started =lsp-mode= translates the local paths to =docker= path and vice versa using the =:path-mappings= specified when calling =lsp-docker-init-default-clients=. You may use =lsp-enabled-clients= and =lsp-disabled-clients= to control what language server will be used to run for a particular project(refer to =lsp-mode= FAQ on how to configure .dir-locals).

** emacslsp/lsp-docker-full
    The container =emacslsp/lsp-docker-full= contains:
    - The above language servers
    - =Emacs28= compiled with native JSON support for better performance.

** Custom language server containers     
   You can use manually built language containers or images hosting language server(s), just follow a few simple rules (shown below).
   
*** Building a container (or an image) manually:
    You have 2 constraints:
    - A language server must be launched in =stdio= mode (other types of communication are yet to be supported)
    - A docker container (only =container= subtype, see the configuration below) must have your language server as an entrypoint (basically you have to be able to launch it with =docker start -i <container_name>= as it is launched this way with =lsp-docker=)

    When you have sucessfully built a language server, you have to register it with either a configuration file or a =.dir-locals= file.

*** Registering a language server using a persistent configuration file:
    A configuration file is a yaml file that is named =.lsp-docker.yml= or =.lsp-docker.yaml= and looks generally like this:
#+begin_src yaml
lsp:
  server:
    type: docker
    subtype: container # Or image. container subtype means launching an existing container
    # image subtype means creating a new container each time from a specified image
    name: not-significant-but-unique-name # Must be unique across all language servers
    server: server-id-of-the-base-server # Server id of a registered server (by lsp-mode) 
    launch_command: "launch command with arguments" # Launch command of the language server
    # (selected by a server id specified above) in stdio mode
    # Note: launch_command is not used with container subtype servers
    # as a command is embedded in a container itself and serves as an entrypoint
  mappings:
    - source: "/your/host/source/path"
      destination: "/your/local/path/inside/a/container"
#+end_src

*** Registering a language server using a =.dir-locals= file:
    Just refer to the source code and general conventions of using =.dir-locals=. The variable you need is =lsp-docker-persistent-default-config=, its content is merged with the =lsp= section from a configuration file (if present).
    
*** Automatic image building:
    You can also build an image automatically (currently supported only for =image= subtype): just drop the corresponding =Dockerfile= into the =.lsp-docker= folder in the project root (=Dockerfile= may be named as =Dockerfile= or =Dockerfile.lsp=). Take a note that you can also place the =.lsp-docker.yml= config there as well. Building process is triggered by the =lsp-docker-register= call (you will be prompted whether you want to build the image). In case of an automatic build the image will be registered automatically (based on the values from the config or =.dir-locals= file).

** Docker over TRAMP (TBD)
   Docker running the language servers and hosting the sources, Emacs running on the desktop machine and connecting to docker instance over TRAMP.
