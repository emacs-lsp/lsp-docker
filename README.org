** Usage
   There are two ways of working with containerized language servers:
   - 2 containers provided by =lsp-docker=:
      - [[#emacslsplsp-docker-langservers][emacslsp/lsp-docker-langservers]]
      - [[#emacslsplsp-docker-full][emacslsp/lsp-docker-full]]
   - [[#custom-language-server-containers][Custom language server containers]]

** emacslsp/lsp-docker-langservers
   This container is used by =lsp-docker= to run =Language Servers= for =lsp-mode= over local sources.
   =You must pull the container before lsp-docker can use it=
*** Configuration
    - Clone the repo
      #+begin_src bash
      git clone https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-docker
      #+end_src
    - Pull the container
      #+begin_src bash
      docker pull emacslsp/lsp-docker-langservers
      #+end_src
    - Add repo to load path and register the docker clients in your =~/.emacs= file
      #+begin_src elisp
      ;; Uncomment the next line if you are using this from source
      ;; (add-to-list 'load-path "<path-to-lsp-docker-dir>")
      (require 'lsp-docker)

      (defvar lsp-docker-client-packages
          '(lsp-css lsp-clients lsp-bash lsp-go lsp-pylsp lsp-html lsp-typescript
            lsp-terraform lsp-clangd))

      (setq lsp-docker-client-configs
          '((:server-id bash-ls :docker-server-id bashls-docker :server-command "bash-language-server start")
            (:server-id clangd :docker-server-id clangd-docker :server-command "clangd")
            (:server-id css-ls :docker-server-id cssls-docker :server-command "css-languageserver --stdio")
            (:server-id dockerfile-ls :docker-server-id dockerfilels-docker :server-command "docker-langserver --stdio")
            (:server-id gopls :docker-server-id gopls-docker :server-command "gopls")
            (:server-id html-ls :docker-server-id htmls-docker :server-command "html-languageserver --stdio")
            (:server-id pylsp :docker-server-id pyls-docker :server-command "pylsp")
            (:server-id ts-ls :docker-server-id tsls-docker :server-command "typescript-language-server --stdio")))

      (require 'lsp-docker)
      (lsp-docker-init-clients
        :path-mappings '(("path-to-projects-you-want-to-use" . "/projects"))
        :client-packages lsp-docker-client-packages
        :client-configs lsp-docker-client-configs)
      #+end_src
*** How it works
    =lsp-mode= starts the image passed as =:docker-image-id= and mounts =:path-mappings= in the container. Then when the process is started =lsp-mode= translates the local paths to =docker= path and vice versa using the =:path-mappings= specified when calling =lsp-docker-init-default-clients=. You may use =lsp-enabled-clients= and =lsp-disabled-clients= to control what language server will be used to run for a particular project(refer to =lsp-mode= FAQ on how to configure .dir-locals).

** emacslsp/lsp-docker-full
    The container =emacslsp/lsp-docker-full= contains:
    - The above language servers
    - =Emacs28= compiled with native JSON support for better performance.

** Custom language server containers     
   You can use manually built language containers or images hosting language server(s), just follow a few simple rules (shown below).
   The docker images may feature an optional tag, if omitted _latest_ will be assumed.
   
*** Building a container (or an image) manually:
    You have 2 constraints:
    - A language server must be launched in =stdio= mode (other types of communication are yet to be supported)
    - A docker container (only =container= subtype, see the configuration below) must have your language server as an entrypoint (basically you have to be able to launch it with =docker start -i <container_name>= as it is launched this way with =lsp-docker=)

    When you have sucessfully built a language server, you have to register it with either a configuration file or a =.dir-locals= file.

*** Registering a language server using a persistent configuration file:
    A configuration file is a yaml file that can be located at:
#+begin_src
<PROJECT_ROOT>/.lsp-docker.yml
<PROJECT_ROOT>/.lsp-docker.yaml
<PROJECT_ROOT>/.lsp-docker/.lsp-docker.yml
<PROJECT_ROOT>/.lsp-docker/.lsp-docker.yaml
<PROJECT_ROOT>/.lsp-docker/lsp-docker.yml
<PROJECT_ROOT>/.lsp-docker/lsp-docker.yaml
<PROJECT_ROOT>/.lsp-docker/config.yml
<PROJECT_ROOT>/.lsp-docker/config.yaml
#+end_src

It is structured in the following way:

#+begin_src yaml
  lsp:
    server:
      type: docker
      # subtype:
      # - "container": attach to an already running container
      # - "image": when image does not exist, try to build it based on the dockerfile found in the project-scope
      #   (see Automatic image building). An image might feature an optional tag, i.e. '<image>:<tag>'. If a
      #   tagless image is indicated 'latest' will be assumed.
      subtype: container
      # image/container name to use for this language server
      name: image-container-name
      # server id of a registered LSP server. You can find the list of registered servers evaluating:
      #
      # `(ht-keys lsp-clients)`
      #
      # source:
      # https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17066169/retrieve-keys-from-hash-table-sorted-by-the-values-efficiently
      server: server-id-of-the-base-server
      # command to launch the language server in stdio mode
      # NOTE: 'launch_command' is not used with 'container' subtype servers as a command is embedded in a
      # container itself and serves as entrypoint
      launch_command: "launch command with arguments"
    mappings:
      # NOTE: the paths must be within the project this server is being build for
      - source: "/your/host/source/path"
        destination: "/your/path/inside/the/container"
#+end_src

*** Registering a language server using a =.dir-locals= file:
    Just refer to the source code and general conventions of using =.dir-locals=. The variable you need is =lsp-docker-persistent-default-config=, its content is merged with the =lsp= section from a configuration file (if present).
    
*** Automatic image building:
    You can also build an image automatically (currently supported only for =image= subtype): just drop the corresponding =Dockerfile= into the =.lsp-docker= folder in the project root (=Dockerfile= may be named as =Dockerfile= or =Dockerfile.lsp=). Building process is triggered by the =lsp-docker-register= call (you will be prompted whether you want to build the image). Image building *takes place in the project root* (*not* in the =.lsp-docker= subfolder)! In case of an automatic build the image will be registered automatically (based on the values from the config or =.dir-locals= file).
    
    You can also troubleshoot any issues with supplemental docker calls (checking whether the required image already exists, building a new image) using the supplemental logging functionality: there are 2 variables: first you have to set =lsp-docker-log-docker-supplemental-calls= to true-like value (by default it is =nil=) and then specify the log buffer in the =lsp-docker-log-docker-supplemental-calls-buffer-name= variable (by default it is set to =*lsp-docker-supplemental-calls*=)

** Docker over TRAMP (TBD)
   Docker running the language servers and hosting the sources, Emacs running on the desktop machine and connecting to docker instance over TRAMP.
